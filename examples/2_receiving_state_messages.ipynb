    "- `ROBOT_MODE`: Current mode of the robot (e.g., RUNNING, Idle).\n",
    "- `Q_ACTUAL`: Current joint positions (radians).\n",
    "- `QD_ACTUAL`: Current joint velocities (radians/second).\n",
    "- `Q_TARGET`: Target joint positions (radians).\n",
    "- `TIMESTAMP`: Timestamp of the status message.\n",
    "- `JOINT_MAX_SPEED`: Maximum joint speeds (radians/second).\n",
    "- `JOINT_MAX_ACCELERATION`: Maximum joint accelerations (radians/second²).\n",
    "- `TCP_POSE`: Current TCP pose (position and orientation).\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive these messages, we will set up a RabbitMQ consumer that listens for messages with the `robotarm.state` routing key. Below is an example of how to implement this in Python using the communication module provided in the project."
