    "- `initial_q`: This parameter sets the initial joint positions of the robot arm in radians. You can modify these values to change the starting pose of the mockup.\n",
    "- `speedup`: This parameter controls the speed multiplier for the mockup's movements. Increasing this value will make the mockup respond faster to control messages.\n",
    "- `publish_frequency`: This parameter defines how often (in Hz) the mockup publishes its state messages. A higher frequency means more frequent updates.\n",
    "- `max_velocity`: This parameter sets the maximum velocity (in degrees per second) for the robot arm joints. Adjusting this value will affect how quickly the mockup can move.\n",
    "- `acceleration`: This parameter sets the maximum acceleration (in degrees per second squared) for the robot arm joints. This affects how quickly the mockup can change its speed.\n",
